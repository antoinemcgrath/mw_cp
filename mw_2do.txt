First table: can you put Cruz and Cornyn on top, then follow them by ALL House incumbents, ideally sequenced by CD so they say TX-**.
No benefit in showing the second table now since it just makes clear we have no data. After the May 22 runoff, this page can list all Repub and Dem candidates for House and we can indicate in bold those with crowdsourced info
