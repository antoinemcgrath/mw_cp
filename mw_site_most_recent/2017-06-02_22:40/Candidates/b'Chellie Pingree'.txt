In 2013, she voted against making it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon by voting against a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions (3). In 2014, she voted for a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (4). In 2015, she voted against HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan (5, 6). In an August 3, 2015 Press Release on the Clean Power Plan, she stated, \xe2\x80\x9cMaine communities are already dealing with the effects of climate change and carbon emissions, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather, and ocean acidification. By reducing these emissions at their greatest source\xe2\x80\x94power plants\xe2\x80\x94we can not only head off future impacts and protect public health, but drive toward utilizing clean energy sources.  With sources like offshore wind and tidal power already being developed in Maine, it would be a huge opportunity for the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy and workforce\xe2\x80\x9d (7).  In a statement supporting the Paris Climate Talks, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI especially appreciate President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in taking steps to cut our greenhouse gas emissions while building our economy through clean energy. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s rising sea levels, ocean acidification, or declining fisheries, we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing the effects of climate change in Maine.  I hope that the conversations in Paris yield effective and comprehensive actions to head off even worse impacts here and around the world\xe2\x80\x9d (8). In a September 23, 2016 Facebook post, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\'s absolutely no denying that climate change is real, it\'s caused by human activity, and we must act now to stop its effects\xe2\x80\x9d (9).\n\n1. \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Vote Results for Roll Call 249\xe2\x80\x9d, Energy Tax Prevention Act 2011, 2011-04-07.   http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll249.xml\n\n2. \xe2\x80\x9cH.R.910 - Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\xe2\x80\x9d, Energy Tax Prevention Act Summary.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/910/\n\n3. \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Vote Results for Roll Call 445\xe2\x80\x9d, Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, 2013-08-02. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll445.xml\n\n4. \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Vote Results for Roll Call 103\xe2\x80\x9d, 2014-03-06. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll103.xml\n\n5. \xe2\x80\x9cH.R. 2042 - Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015\xe2\x80\x9d, House of Representatives Committee on Rules. https://rules.house.gov/bill/114/hr-2042\n\n6. \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Vote Results for Roll Call 384\xe2\x80\x9d, 2015-06-24. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll384.xml\n\n7. \xe2\x80\x9cStatement on President\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Power Plan\xe2\x80\x9d, 2015-08-03 Press Release. https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/statement-president-s-clean-power-plan\n\n8. \xe2\x80\x9cPingree applauds climate change talks in Paris\xe2\x80\x9d, 2015-12-01 Press Release. https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pingree-applauds-climate-change-talks-paris\n\n9.

It\'s another piece of evidence that climate change is real, it\'s happening now and we should be long past the point where politicians are debating whether it really exists.
