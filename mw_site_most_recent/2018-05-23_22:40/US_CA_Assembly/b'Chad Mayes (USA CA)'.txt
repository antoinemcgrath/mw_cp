In 2016, he voted against SB 32, which mandates an 80% reduction in California\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (2). Regardless of his previous opposition to carbon reduction, in 2017 Mayes became an "unexpected ally" in working with Democrats on extending the cap-and-trade program (3). He argued "[Now that the reduction goals have been set, Republicans] can either decide to not engage and let it be really bad for our economy and the people of California, or we can engage and say we\xe2\x80\x99re going to protect the environment and make sure that California is a place we can still afford to live in.
