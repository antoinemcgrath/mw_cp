|Q2=Cecilia Aguiar-Curry also criticized SB350, the Clean Energy & Pollution Reduction Act, saying she was worried about the economic impact of gas price increases. “Aguiar-Curry made it clear she wouldn’t back every climate change bill. For example, she criticized Senate Bill 350. The original version of the bill featured a petroleum-cutting requirement that some – including Aguiar-Curry – feared would have raised gas prices.”
