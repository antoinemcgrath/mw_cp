|WikiDraftSum=In April 2016, Neal Dunn said "I am sure human activity plays some role, but I don’t think the science is clear on how much is man-made and how much is natural. What I do know is that the United States should not follow the path of the global warming alarmists like the Obama administration who wants us to unilaterally handicap ... industry with over-burdensome EPA regulations," (1). In August 2016, he stated that he "opposed" funding the Green Climate Fund to help poor countries better mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change (2).
