|WikiDraftSum=In 2011, Richard Shelby voted to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (1). In 2013, he voted for a concurrent resolution creating a point of order which would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon (2, 3). In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about Keystone on January 21, 2015, (4) he voted against Amendment 87 by Sen. Hoeven that climate change is real and human activity contributes to climate change (5), and against Amendment 58 by Sen. Schatz, that human activity "significantly" contributes to climate change (6). In 2015, he wrote, “I certainly understand your concerns regarding global warming which continues to be an issue of significant debate in Congress and throughout the scientific community. Important scientific research is ongoing, and there are still many questions that must be answered before we take steps to address this issue. For example, is the climate change phenomenon cyclical or is it a function of man-made pollutants, or both? I believe the science must be firmly grounded before we take any actions that could seriously cripple many sectors of our economy” (7). In 2015, he voted against the Clean Power Plan (8).
