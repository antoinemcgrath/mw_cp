His campaign website says, “I worked to pass an energy bill that set ambitious targets for renewable and advanced energy—by 2025, 25% of energy sold in Ohio must be from renewable or advanced energy sources. This standard created new industries, brought jobs to Ohio, and helped address the issue of climate change.” http://www.tedstrickland.com/meet-ted/accomplishments Accessed 2016-09-07
