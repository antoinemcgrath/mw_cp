In 2016 he stated, "Alaska \xe2\x80\x93 and Alaska Native villages \xe2\x80\x93 are at ground-zero for climate change. The effects are clearly visible: where drastic coastal erosion is forcing villages to move inland, in the interior where melting permafrost damages infrastructure, in Southeast where acidification affects our fisheries, and on river systems where the early melting of ice prevents safe travel between villages. Alaska must be at the forefront of climate research, technology, adaptation, and renewable energy. And as villages prepare, adapt, or move in-land, Alaska Native communities deserve a leading voice in that process" (2).\n\n\n\n1.

Alaska must continue to invest in solar, tidal, and wind power, which reduces costs and provides clean, sustainable sources of energy, reducing reliance on costly fuel."\nhttps://lindbeckforalaska.com/issues\n|OtherSources=None found.\n}}'
