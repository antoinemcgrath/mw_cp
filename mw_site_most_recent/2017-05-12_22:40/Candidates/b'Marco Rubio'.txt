(1) In 2013, he voted for a concurrent resolution creating a point of order which would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon. (2, 3) In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about the Keystone on January 21, 2015 (4), he voted against Amendment 87 by Sen. Hoeven that climate change is real and human activity contributes to climate change (5), and against Amendment 58 by Sen. Schatz, that human activity "significantly" contributes to climate change. (6) On March 10, 2016 during a debate, when asked about the scientific consensus on climate change he said \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. There\'s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?\xe2\x80\x9d (7)\n\n\n1.
