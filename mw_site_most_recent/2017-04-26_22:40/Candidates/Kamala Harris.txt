|WikiDraftSum=Kamala Harris’ official Attorney General site states, “Global warming and disruptive climate change pose great risks for California. Climate change will result in more frequent and more intense forest fires, more air pollution and deadly heat waves, a significant reduction in the snowpack and state water supplies, sea level rise and erosion along California's long coastline, and billions of dollars in damage to our agricultural, tourism, recreation, and other industries” (1). Her campaign’s Environment Issues page states, “as Attorney General, Kamala defended California’s landmark climate change law from challenges by the biggest polluters, like Big Oil… In the Senate, Kamala will stand up to the climate change deniers and fight to pass national climate change legislation that promotes innovation like establishing a carbon tax or creating a cap-and-trade market for carbon pollution…This year saw the Sierra snowpack - a vital source of water for California - at its lowest level in 500 years. Californians can see the bathtub rings that now line our reservoirs, showing where these critical reserves once stood just a few years ago. Climate change is a clear threat to our water supply, public health, and our economy” (2).
