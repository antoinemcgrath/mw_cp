|WikiDraftSum=On his campaign site, Scott Peter states "developing the models for true sustainability must happen now, before it's too late to sufficiently respond to climate change and rising sea levels, extreme weather, and prolonged drought," (1). He is currently the Chair of the Democratic Caucus Climate Task Force (2). On his Congressional site, he says "San Diego continues to experience drought, wildfires, and flooding due to sea level rise. These phenomena are expected to increase and we must provide communities with the tools they need to prepare for, and more quickly recover from, extreme weather events," (3).
