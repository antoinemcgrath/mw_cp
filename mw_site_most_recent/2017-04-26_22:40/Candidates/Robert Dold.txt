|WikiDraftSum=In 2015, Robert Dodd supported HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan (1, 2). In April 2016, he joined the new House Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus (3). In an April 25, 2016 blog post, he wrote, “Climate change is occurring and human contributions to this change are important to acknowledge and understand” (4). On his campaign’s Priorities page he states, “Furthermore, as scientific experts have developed a more comprehensive understanding of our planet’s changing climate, it has become clear that we must do more to protect our planet. While specific policy solutions may differ, we must work together to acknowledge the issue and find a sensible path forward… I was one of less than a dozen Republican cosponsors on a resolution acknowledging climate change and expressing a commitment to finding solutions to address this issue” (5).
