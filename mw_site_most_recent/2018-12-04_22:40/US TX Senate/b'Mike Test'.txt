But the scientific aspect that I still reserving judgment on is the extent to which it\'s manmade or natural." (1) In 2014, he said, "We had global warming between 1940 and 1998. Since then, we haven\'t had a rise in temperature." In November 2015, he voted for a resolution of disapproval saying the Clean Power Plan "shall have no force or effect." (2) In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about the Keystone XL Pipeline on January 21, 2015, he voted against Amendment 87 by Sen. Hoeven that human activity is real and contributes to climate change, and against Amendment 58 by Sen. Schatz, that human activity "significantly" contributes to climate change. (3,4)\n\n1.
