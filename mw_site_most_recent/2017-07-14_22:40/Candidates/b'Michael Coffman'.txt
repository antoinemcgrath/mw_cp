In 2014, he voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (2). In 2015, he supported HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan (3, 4). On his House website\xe2\x80\x99s Issues page, he states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe role that carbon emissions, from human activity, have on climate change is still a subject of debate. But what is clear is that we should do all that we can to reduce carbon emissions in order to improve the quality of our environment. However, we should do so under a balanced approach that considers the economic impact of the rate at which we reduce our carbon emissions\xe2\x80\xa6No doubt, there will always be those with extreme views about climate change.
