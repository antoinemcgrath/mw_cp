But the scientific aspect that I still reserving judgment on is the extent to which it\'s manmade or natural." (1) In 2014, he said, "We had global warming between 1940 and 1998. Since then, we haven\'t had a rise in temperature." In November 2015, he voted for a resolution of disapproval saying the Clean Power Plan "shall have no force or effect."
