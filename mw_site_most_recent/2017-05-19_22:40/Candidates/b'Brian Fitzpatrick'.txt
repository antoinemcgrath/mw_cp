So what do we do with disputed evidence? Should we take reasonable measures to protect the environment? Of course we should. Should we go overboard to the point where we\xe2\x80\x99re shutting down businesses, strangling businesses with regulations so that, in order to comply with these regulations? They threaten their businesses, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to many business owners that have told me as such, as far as the paperwork and the administrative burden and the cost for marginal, if any, environmental benefit? No. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of being reasonable. We all care about our environment, we all love our planet, but we have to be smart about how we go about addressing it\xe2\x80\x9d.
