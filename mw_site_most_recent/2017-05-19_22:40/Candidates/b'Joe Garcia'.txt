In 2014, he voted for a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (2). In 2014, he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cAmong the world\xe2\x80\x99s many pressing issues, climate change is perhaps the greatest threat to long-term peace and prosperity\xe2\x80\xa6It has become a sort of tradition at this point in articles about climate change to assert that there is widespread scientific consensus that the earth is warming, that man-made carbon pollution is the cause of this warming, and that to say otherwise is silly. I make that assertion now. The reason why this disclaimer must be issued is that there is a small but powerful faction that has for years sought to block and delay action by sowing confusion about the reality and sources of climate change\xe2\x80\xa6I represent South Miami and the Florida Keys, including the unique and treasured Everglades, in Congress\xe2\x80\xa6I spend my days working on the issues people are concerned about: jobs, immigration, education, etc. But increasingly my staff and I work on trying to resolve the real problems caused by rising sea levels and salt water intrusion. Seawater threatens wastewater treatment plants, high tides and rain storms are threaten to overwhelm drainage systems, high temperatures and flooding are harming crops and wildlife, and disaster insurance premium hikes are undermining local economies. South Floridians are stepping up to the challenge of climate change because we have no choice: It is literally at our doorstep. For us, this is not just a debate, it is a new realty we are obligated to deal with.
