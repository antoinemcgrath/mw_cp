|Q3=In an article on the importance of local action on climate change, Ash Kalra was quoted as saying, “California’s role is more important than it’s ever been...we have to stand out as the shining example in our nation. We don’t need to wait for Washington, D.C.” And “We already have been. Environmental issues are inherently local anyway. Every decision that we make, from the cars that we drive to the food that we eat, has a cumulative impact on the climate.”
