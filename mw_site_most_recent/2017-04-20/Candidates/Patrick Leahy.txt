|WikiDraftSum=In 2011, he voted against limiting EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. (1) In 2013, he voted to make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon through a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. (The vote did not pass by 2/3.). (2) In 2015, he voted in support of the Clean Power Plan. (3) On the Climate Change page of his Senate website, Patrick Leahy states “It is now recognized as a fact that climate change, while possibly grounded in a series of natural weather patterns and global shifts in temperature, is largely an anthropogenic phenomenon.  Human activity, since the Industrial Revolution, has contributed, in large part, to the changes in climate that are now upon us.  Contrary to what many believe, global warming and climate change are distinct.  Global warming refers solely to increases in temperature worldwide, whereas climate change refers to observable changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns.” (4)
