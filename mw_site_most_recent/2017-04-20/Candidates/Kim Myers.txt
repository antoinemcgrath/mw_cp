|WikiDraftSum=On her campaign’s Issues page, she states, “Congress continues to subsidize the production and use of fossil fuels, which contributes to environmental degradation and climate change and keeps  us reliant on a non-renewable energy sources. We need to shift away from our reliance on oil and gas and move towards clean, renewable energy…An increased reliance on clean, renewable energy sources will not only decrease pollution and combat climate change but can also serve as an important job creator…We can enact simple changes at the federal level to protect the environment which help save taxpayers money while leading efforts to end climate change and protect the environment.  In Congress, I will support existing legislation that mandates that federal government prioritize clean energy options in all contracts and procurement and reduce its own energy output in the coming decades. I support efforts to ensure 25% of federal agency use is from renewable resources by 2025” (1).
