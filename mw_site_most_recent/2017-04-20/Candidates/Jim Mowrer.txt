In 2016, he said, “I believe that preserving our natural resources for future generations is a moral responsibility of every generation and climate change is an existential threat to our national security, our economy, and especially to our way of life here in Iowa...As an Iowan, where we get more of our energy from wind than all other states besides Texas, we’ve seen the benefits of investing in clean, renewable energy and job growth. We need to continue to see more growth along these lines.”

|Q2=On his campaign Issues page, he says he will: "Take action against Climate Change by supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, because Iowa has the most to lose from a changing climate and the most to gain by being a clean energy leader. Restore the tax credit for wind energy to its full amount. Our government should not be rewarding oil companies with huge tax credits while limiting wind tax credits that will move our nation toward a clean energy future where we don’t rely on other countries for our fuel. End tax breaks for Big Oil so that we can invest more into clean energy initiatives and programs that benefit working families. Strengthen the Renewable Fuel Standard...We must work to strengthen and enhance the RFS not remove it".

|Q3=On his campaign Issues page, he states, "With the rise in unpredictable weather events like catastrophic floods that threaten farmers’ livelihoods, Iowa has the most to lose by not acting on climate change and the most to gain by remaining a leader in clean energy production and protecting our environment."
