|WikiDraftSum=In 2011, Mike Lee voted to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. (1) In 2013, he voted to make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon through a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. (The vote did not pass by 2/3.). (2) In 2015, he voted against the Clean Power Plan. (3) On May 31, 2016 Mike Lee posted on Facebook: “It has long been obvious that the Democratic Party’s assertion that the science of climate change is “settled” is little more than a cheap public-relations ploy masquerading as a monopoly on scientific knowledge. To give the matter a moment’s thought is to recognize that science – that field of inquiry dedicated to testing new theories, challenging prevailing views of the natural world, and overturning the conventional wisdom of the scientific community – cannot be settled.” (4)
