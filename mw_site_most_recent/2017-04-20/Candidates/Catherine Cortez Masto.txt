|WikiDraftSum=In 2015, Catherine Cortez Masto said, “the Clean Power Plan is a bold step not just in lowering carbon emissions, but also in creating the clean energy jobs of the future. With our abundance of wind, solar, and geothermal energy, Nevada has been a leader in moving away from carbon emissions and embracing a clean energy economy that has created good-paying jobs in our state that can’t be shipped overseas.” (1) In a Facebook post on Dec. 5, 2015, she wrote, “We all have an obligation to leave our planet better off for future generations. But if we don't take bold and decisive action, we continue to run the risk of further damaging our planet and depriving our children of what they deserve. A healthy Mother Earth is not a luxury; it is a necessity. That is exactly why I support President Obama's Clean Power Plan. This bold plan is the most ambitious effort to address climate change to date.” (2)
