In 2014, he voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll103.xml 

In 2015, as a member of Congress, he supported HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll384.xml
