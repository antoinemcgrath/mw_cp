|WikiDraftSum=In 2013, he voted to make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon by voting for a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions (1). In 2014, he voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (2). In 2015, he supported HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan (3, 4). On his House website’s Issues page, he states, “The role that carbon emissions, from human activity, have on climate change is still a subject of debate. But what is clear is that we should do all that we can to reduce carbon emissions in order to improve the quality of our environment. However, we should do so under a balanced approach that considers the economic impact of the rate at which we reduce our carbon emissions…No doubt, there will always be those with extreme views about climate change. They do not care if their radical environmental solutions punish working middle class families” (5).

|Q1=On his House website’s Issues page, he states, “There is no question that climate change is real and has existed since the beginning of time, and will always be a factor that can negatively impact our environment. The role that carbon emissions, from human activity, have on climate change is still a subject of debate. But what is clear is that we should do all that we can to reduce carbon emissions in order to improve the quality of our environment. However, we should do so under a balanced approach that considers the economic impact of the rate at which we reduce our carbon emissions…No doubt, there will always be those with extreme views about climate change. They do not care if their radical environmental solutions punish working middle class families.”
