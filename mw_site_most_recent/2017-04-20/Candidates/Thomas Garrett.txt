|WikiDraftSum=In a 2016 debate, Tom Garrett said, "We know there’s climate change. There is debate as to whether it’s man-caused climate change. What we need to do is take a long hard look at both sides of the science, determine what amount of the climate change is man-caused, and then act appropriately after doing a cost-benefit analysis of what we give up and what we gain by that action” (1).
