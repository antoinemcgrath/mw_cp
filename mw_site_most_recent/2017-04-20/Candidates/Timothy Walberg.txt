|Q1=In 2008, when asked about the role of the federal government in combatting climate change, Tim Walberg said, "I think the federal government ought to give incentives to business, industry, and more importantly research institutions to do what's necessary to find out what really is taking place. I don't think it can be just people like Al Gore...I think it needs to be people who are doing significant research to find out if, indeed, we are warming...When I read science, I read scientists, editors, at least equal on both sides that say there's a cycle that significant warming that's produced by human involvement...then I read on the other side an equal number at the very least that say just the very opposite that this is something that's gone on for eons..."
