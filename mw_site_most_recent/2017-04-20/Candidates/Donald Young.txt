|WikiDraftSum=In 2013, Don Young voted for a concurrent resolution creating a point of order which would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon (1, 2). In 2014, he voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (3, 4). In 2015, he voted against the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (5, 6, 7).

On his campaign Issues page, he states, "I do not challenge that climate change is occurring, but the central question awaiting an answer is to what extent man-made emissions are responsible for this change.  Contrary to popular opinion, that question remains unanswered.  Those who claim otherwise perpetrate a tremendous disservice to science and society, and I am shocked by the continued marginalization of any dissenters" (8).
