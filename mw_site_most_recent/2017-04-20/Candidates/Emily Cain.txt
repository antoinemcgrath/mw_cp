|WikiDraftSum=In a 2016 Facebook post, she wrote, “All of us have a moral and economic imperative to address climate change and safeguard public health” (1). On her campaign’s Issues page, she states, “The strength of Maine’s economy and our ability to create jobs is connected to the health of our environment. To preserve our way of life, our fishing and farming economy, and the health of our children, Maine must be a leader in the fight to stop global climate change. From farmers and lobstermen to snowmobilers and hunters- Maine people who enjoy the outdoors or make their living there know that our climate is changing. It’s no coincidence that the 2016 Maine Fisherman’s Forum focused on communicating climate change science to the people who work in our fisheries” (2).
