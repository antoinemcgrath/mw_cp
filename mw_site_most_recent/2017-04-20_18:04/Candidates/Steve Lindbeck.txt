|WikiDraftSum=Regarding climate change, Steve Lindbeck said Alaska doesn’t have the luxury of pretending it’s not true (1). In 2016 he stated, "Alaska – and Alaska Native villages – are at ground-zero for climate change. The effects are clearly visible: where drastic coastal erosion is forcing villages to move inland, in the interior where melting permafrost damages infrastructure, in Southeast where acidification affects our fisheries, and on river systems where the early melting of ice prevents safe travel between villages. Alaska must be at the forefront of climate research, technology, adaptation, and renewable energy. And as villages prepare, adapt, or move in-land, Alaska Native communities deserve a leading voice in that process" (2).

Alaska is on the front lines of climate change, and we must be a national leader on climate change technology and adaptation.
On his campaign Issue's page he states, "The effects are clearly visible: where drastic coastal erosion is forcing villages to move inland, in the interior where melting permafrost damages infrastructure, in Southeast where acidification affects our fisheries, and on river systems where the early melting of ice prevents safe travel between villages. Alaska must continue to invest in solar, tidal, and wind power, which reduces costs and provides clean, sustainable sources of energy, reducing reliance on costly fuel."
