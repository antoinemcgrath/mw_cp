|WikiDraftSum=On June 24, 2015, Rep. Patrick Murphy voted against letting governors opt-out of carbon pollution standards for power plants. (1) In a September 26, 2015 post on Medium, he wrote “We Can--and Must--Tackle the Climate Crisis…I truly believe that we have a responsibility to act on climate change. Furthermore, I agree that this is something we can accomplish…As a native Floridian, born and raised in the Florida Keys and living along South Florida’s beaches my entire life, the threats to our coastline and our community because of climate change are not only deeply troubling, but personal. In fact, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper shows that one foot of sea level rise threatens the majority of our local coastline, and that many of these areas most vulnerable to climate change are also home to our most vulnerable community members, such as the elderly and the poor.” (2) On December 1, 2015 he voted in support of the Clean Power Plan.

His campaign’s Our Environment page states “With climate change already impacting Florida, Patrick knows that the time to act is now. Climate change is not some obscure problem for future generations to solve. Florida is ground zero for the effects of climate change, including sunny-day flooding on Miami Beach, coastal erosion, and the ocean’s intrusion into our drinking water.” https://www.murphyforflorida.com/vision/our-environment/ Accessed 2016-09-11.
