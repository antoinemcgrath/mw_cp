|WikiDraftSum=In a 2016 interview, Scott Jones said, "The Republicans deny climate change is even happening. And there’s some authority for that. The Democrats, that’s one of their primary issues. And there’s plenty (of) authority for that as well. I think the issue should be: Are the byproducts of our views on climate change worthwhile to pursue?"
