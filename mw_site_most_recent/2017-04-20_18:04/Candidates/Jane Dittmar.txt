|Q1=When asked about climate change at a 2016 debate, Jane Dittmar said,  “We need to go at this two ways. One, how do we adapt? We must adapt. The other is how do we mitigate or slow it down, and that will require us taking a long hard look at our relationship with fossil fuels. Our economy depends on energy as do we, in our homes. We need to move gracefully to natural gas and really stimulate our renewable clean energy sector in the future.”
