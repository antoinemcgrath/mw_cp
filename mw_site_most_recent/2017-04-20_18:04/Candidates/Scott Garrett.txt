|WikiDraftSum=In 2010, Scott Garrett said, "The real question that still exists in a lot of people's minds, experts and non-experts alike, on the area of global warming and what role the government should have in this realm. ... I've heard a number of experts on both sides of the equation on this issue and to me the evidence, the question is still out there" (1). In 2011, he voted to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases (2, 3, 4).
