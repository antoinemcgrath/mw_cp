|Q2=

'''Automatically Generated Congressional Votes'''

In 2013, she voted to make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon by voting for a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll445.xml 

In 2014, she voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll103.xml 

In 2015, as a member of Congress, she supported HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll384.xml
