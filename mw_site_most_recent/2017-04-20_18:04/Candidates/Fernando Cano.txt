|WikiDraftSum=Christian Cano stated, "One of the deadliest problems facing not just the United States, but the entire world, is Climate Change. If we do not take immediate action to combat the drastic effects that climate change poses on our world, there will be dire consequences. Our next generation will feel it significantly and then the next generation after that even more so. But we do not have to look that far into the future because it is already happening. And while it is not too late to fight it, we are getting awfully close to blowing our last opportunity to turn things around. One of the most direct impacts of climate change will be felt right in our district. We have vast opportunities within our agricultural industry in the Ninth District and throughout the whole state. If we continue to sit idly by, we will allow temperatures to rise and heat waves to stretch which will destroy opportunities to grow things such as corn, sweet potatoes, soy beans, live stock, fruits and so on. This will greatly damage, if not completely destroy, our state and local economy. Instead of attacking one another about the causes of climate change, let’s work to slow and stop it by reducing state and global carbon emissions, moving towards clean energy, upgrade our infrastructure in energy efficient ways, and change the way we consume" (1).
