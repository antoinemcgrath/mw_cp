|WikiDraftSum=n 2011, Scott Tipton voted to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases (1, 2, 3). 
In a 2012 interview, he conceded that climate change exists, but argued that it’s caused by natural climate cycles rather than humans and implied that acknowledging human impacts on climate would "divide America" (4). In 2013, he voted for a concurrent resolution creating a point of order which would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon (5, 6). In 2014, he voted against a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects (7, 8). In 2015, he voted against the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (9, 10, 11). (Hyperlink Clean Power Plan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Power_Plan)
