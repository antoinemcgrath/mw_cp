|Q1=In 2010 Ryan Zinke advocated for the passage of clean energy and climate legislation, but in 2014 he said he is a geologist and that he has seen no scientific evidence that fracking is environmentally dangerous or that climate change is changing the weather. He also said, “I’m a conservationist, but when there’s a volcano in the Philippines that erupts and produces more C02 than humans have produced in 200 years – is C02 really the problem?” (A U.S. Geological Survey fact sheet on volcanic carbon dioxide production cited peer-reviewed scientific studies that concluded human activities produce 35 billion metric tons per year, dwarfing the 0.26 billion metric tons produced by volcanoes).
