|Q1=In October 2015, Paul said, "we have twenty-, thirty-, hundred-thousand sort of year cycles that go on with the climate. It has been much warmer than it is today. We have real data [for] about 100 years. So somebody tell me what 100 years data is in an Earth that is 4.6 billion years old? My guess is that the conclusions you make from that are not conclusive." http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/10/30/rand_paul_on_climate_change_how_much_is_man_and_how_much_is_nature.html#!
