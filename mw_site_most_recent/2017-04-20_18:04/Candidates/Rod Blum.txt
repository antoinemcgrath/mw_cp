|WikiDraftSum=In a 2014 interview when asked about climate change, he said, "I’m skeptical...We go from that, to now global warming, and that’s been changed to climate change. I’m not a scientist, and I know most scientists’ paychecks come from the federal government, and so right away that makes me a bit skeptical.  Thirty  years ago we were going into a global cooling period.  That makes me skeptical" (1). In 2015, he voted against the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (2, 3, 4).
