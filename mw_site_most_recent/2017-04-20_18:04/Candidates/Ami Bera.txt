|Q2=

'''Automatically Generated Congressional Votes'''

In 2013, he voted against making it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon by voting against a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll445.xml 

In 2014, he voted for a House amendment calling on Congress to recognize that man-made carbon pollution contributes to climate change and that climate change has a wide range of negative effects. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll103.xml 

In 2015, as a member of Congress he voted against HR 2042, The Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have prevented implementation of the Clean Power Plan. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll384.xml 

|Q3=He said, "We must address the grave threat that climate change poses to our state of California and to future generations. The vast majority of qualified scientists agree that the data on climate change is clear. The evidence shows climate change is making our drought worse and could lead to future droughts. Climate change is expected to result in rising sea levels, which could damage the Sacramento delta and major coastal cities throughout the Bay Area. It could also mean more out-of-control forest fires and more dangerous storms, affecting our countryâ€™s agriculture and infrastructure".
