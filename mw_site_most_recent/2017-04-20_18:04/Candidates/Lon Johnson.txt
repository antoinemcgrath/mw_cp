|Q2=At an October 2016 candidate forum, Lon Johnson said federal leaders must drive investment in renewable sources of energy, making the U.S. a leader in attacking the problem and "We have to work with other countries, but we have to lead by example. We can't just stand here and not address our changing climate because some other country doesn't. We cannot be afraid to lead and show the world how to address climate change and do it in a way that doesn't disrupt our marketplace".
