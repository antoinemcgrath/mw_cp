|WikiDraftSum=On his Campaign’s Issues page, Jim Barksdale states, “Climate change is a reality and if left unchecked, rising ocean tides will harm Georgia’s Atlantic coast and threaten our state’s robust tourism and shipping industries. It is grossly irresponsible that so many elected leaders in the Washington crowd listen to special interests and their lobbyists to refute the scientific evidence of man-made climate change in exchange for campaign cash to fuel their reelection campaigns at the expense of the people” (1).
