|WikiDraftSum=In 2011, as a Representative, Joe Heck voted to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. (1) In 2012, when asked about climate change and regulating carbon dioxide, he stated: “When you start looking at trying to regulate something like carbon dioxide, which is a natural, biological process, you start running into areas of confusion” and “I think certainly over the millennia, we've seen changes in our climate both ways, and I think throughout the future millennia we will continue to see climate change that goes both ways. But the issue for this election is not what's going to be happening in the next 200 years, it's going to be what's happening in the next 12 months.” (2) In 2013, he voted for a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions.
