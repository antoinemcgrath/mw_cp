(Climate One, accessed June 18, 2017, https://climateone.org/people/jean-fuller)\n|Q2=Jane Fuller represents Senate District 16, located in the Central Valley of California. Fuller views her constituency as "home to oil producers and manufacturers." (Rory Carroll, "California legislature passes climate change bills," August 24, 2016, http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-climate-law-idUSKCN10Z2SM) \n\nFuller voted against SB 350, which established new California clean energy, clean air and greenhouse gas reduction goals for 2030. She stated, "[with the bill] we are going to lose more jobs. We had solar and wind energy jobs as well as gas and oil. In our county, we are basically suffering a net deficit of jobs based on these policies." (Jane Fuller, "No Bipartisan Support for Job Killer Bill," June 3, 2015, http://fuller.cssrc.us/content/no-bipartisan-support-job-killer-bill)\n\nAs Minority Leader, Fuller spoke on the Floor of the Senate in opposition prior to the vote on SB 32, which mandates an 80% reduction in the state\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. She remarked the bill as a "job killer." (CA Senate Republican Caucus, "Senate Republican Leader Fights to Protect California Jobs," August, 2016, http://cssrc.us/content/senate-republican-leader-fights-protect-california-jobs) In response to Governor Brown\xe2\x80\x99s signing of the bill, Fuller released a statement. "It is unfortunate but not surprising that the governor has chosen to sign this job killing legislation," she said, "climate change policies already passed by the majority party have had a drastic and negative impact on Kern County, costing us hundreds of energy jobs and causing our local economy to suffer."
