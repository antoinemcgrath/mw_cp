|WikiDraftSum=On April 6, 2011, Ron Wyden voted against limiting the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (1). On March 22, 2013 he voted against a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions (2). On May 6, 2014, in response to the release of the National Climate Assessment, he said, “Today’s report adds to the ever-growing body of scientific evidence and on-the-ground proof that the effects of climate change are already being felt in every region of the United States. This assessment confirms what the people of the Pacific Northwest already know – that sea levels are rising, wildfires are getting worse and water supplies are diminishing – hitting right at the heart of the local economy in Oregon and elsewhere. It also confirms that these effects will continue to get worse if strong actions are not taken immediately to curb emissions of greenhouse gases and move toward a low-carbon economy” (3). On June 2, 2014, he said, “American businesses, farmers, ranchers and families are experiencing the effects of climate change in the United States today. Inaction on climate change is no longer an option…Climate change is the most important environmental challenge of our time. Without immediate action, its effects will only get worse” (4). On November 17, 2015 he voted in support of the Clean Power Plan (5). <br>
