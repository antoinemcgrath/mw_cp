|OtherSources=Her campaign website supports an “all of the above strategy” for energy without addressing climate change: “Our nation is blessed with a variety of natural resources that can help to meet our energy needs, and I believe that we should explore all of those options and strive to become energy independent. That includes investing in renewable energy like solar, wind, and nuclear as well as developing traditional forms of energy like coal, oil, and natural gas. It is only by adopting an ‘all of the above strategy’ that we can truly become energy independent.” (1)
