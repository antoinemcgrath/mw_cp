|WikiDraftSum=Ron Johnson said in 2010, "I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. It's not proven by any stretch of the imagination. It's far more likely that it's sunspot activity or just something in the geologic eons of time." (1) In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about the Keystone XL Pipeline on January 21, 2015, he voted against Amendment 87 by Sen. Hoeven that human activity is real and contributes to climate change (2), and against Amendment 58 by Sen. Schatz, that human activity "significantly" contributes to climate change (3). In November 2015, he voted for a resolution of disapproval saying that the Clean Power Plan “shall have no force or effect” (4)
