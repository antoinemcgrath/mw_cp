|WikiDraftSum=In a video on his campaign’s Facebook page, Jay Williams says, “Climate change is the biggest issue we face today, because it is an issue that will face our children and grandchildren and we have to face what we are doing to our environment right now because if we don’t the planet may become unliveable, but at the very least it is going to be very hard for our children to get along in this world when the temperature has gone up so bad that they need to actually extract carbon from the environment.” (1) His campaign Issues page states, “This planet is the only home we have. It's our responsibility to ensure we don't destroy it. Jay will support legislation to curb carbon emissions and protect the environment.” (2)

His campaign Issues page states, “According to NOAA, 14 of the 15 hottest years on record since modern record keeping began in 1880 occurred in the 21st century. Last year, 2015, was the hottest year on record, and 2014 was the second hottest. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is increasing, heat waves are becoming more frequent, more than a million species could be driven to extinction by 2050, worldwide sea levels are rising, and sea ice is melting. This planet is the only home we have. It's our responsibilty to ensure we don't destroy it. Jay will support legislation to curb carbon emissions and protect the environment”.
