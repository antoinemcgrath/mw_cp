|Q1=In 2013, John Boozman said, "Well I think that we've got perhaps climate change going on. The question is what's causing it. Is man causing it, or, you know, is this a cycle that happens throughout the years, throughout the ages. And you can look back some of the previous times when there was no industrialization, you had these different ages, ice ages, and things warming and things. That's the question."  The article also mentions that “He also once compared the scientists who believe in man-made climate change to those who warned about Y2K”.
