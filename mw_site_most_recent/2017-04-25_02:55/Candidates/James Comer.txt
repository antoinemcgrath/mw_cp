|OtherSources=In 2013, he said "A lot of leaders in Eastern Kentucky keep talking about ‘coal is the answer and there is a war on coal.’ I’m a friend of coal. I support the coal industry. But the coal industry’s future doesn’t look bright and we have to look beyond that and learn to develop a new economy in Eastern Kentucky." http://wfpl.org/challenging-eastern-kentucky-leaders-ag-commissioner-james-comer-says-its-time-look-beyond-coal/
