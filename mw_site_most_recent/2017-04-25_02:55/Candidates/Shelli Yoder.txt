|OtherSources=She said, "We must recognize the challenges that climate change poses to our communities, but Indiana needs to step forward and become a national leader in clean energy technology. We can protect our natural resources, and create good-paying jobs across the district. I support an "all of the above" energy policy that prioritizes domestic job creation and invests in new and renewable energies for the future."
