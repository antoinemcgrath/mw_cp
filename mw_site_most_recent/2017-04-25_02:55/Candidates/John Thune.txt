|WikiDraftSum=In 2011, John Thune voted to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. (1) In 2013, he voted to make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon through a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. (The vote did not pass by 2/3.) (2) In a November 16, 2014 interview, he said “Well, look, climate change is occurring, it's always occurring, Chris. There are a number of factors that contribute to that, including human activity. The question is, what are we going to do about it and at what cost?” (3) In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about Keystone on January 21, 2015, he voted against Amendment 87 by Sen. Hoeven that climate change is real and human activity contributes to climate change (4), and against Amendment 58 by Sen. Schatz, that human activity "significantly" contributes to climate change.
